## Conversion rate optimization

Conversion optimization, or conversion rate optimization (CRO) is a system for increasing the percentage of visitors to a website that convert into customers, or more generally, take any desired action on a webpage.
In order to increase revenues, it's important for a company to optimize this rate.

Machine learning can help us predict the conversion rate and then make recommandations.

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Fraudulent activities detection

E-commerce sites transfer a lot of money. This can lead to significant risks of fraudulent activities, such as the use of stolen credit cards, money laundering, etc.
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that allows to predict the probability of a fraudulent transaction.

## NLP with Disaster Tweets

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter.

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster e.g. using irony

Can a model help us determine if a tweet is related to a real disaster ?

## Recommender System using collaborative filtering with Yelp

Using machine learning to make a restaurant recommender system.  

Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer "relevant" suggestions to users. Categorized as either collaborative filtering or a content-based system. 

Collaborative filtering methods for recommender systems are methods that are solely based on the past interactions between users and the target items.
